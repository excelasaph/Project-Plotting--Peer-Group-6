# Project Plotting - Matplotlib & Seaborn: Histograms and Boxplots

## Assignment Overview
This project involves analyzing transportation data, specifically vehicle and fuel efficiency, using Python's data visualization libraries. The objective is to extract insights from the data through diagrams that illustrate relationships between various features.

The analysis is a crucial step in preparing this data for future AI applications.

## Objectives
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Import the dataset and necessary libraries.
   - Display a preview of the data (4 to 10 rows).

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create a histogram to analyze the distribution of a selected feature.
   - Generate a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - Provide meaningful insights from the diagrams through comments or text.

4. **Submission Requirements**:
   - Export PNG files of the plots.
   - Submit the source code as a `.ipynb` file.

## Required Libraries
The following Python libraries were imported:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and exploration.
- **matplotlib**: To create static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical plots.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Setup**:
   - Download the starter notebook and dataset.
   - Upload both files to your environment or drive.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Import libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, and `numpy`).
   - Load the dataset and display a preview of 4 to 10 rows.

3. **Plotting**:
   - **Histogram**:
     - Plot the distribution of a selected feature (e.g., fuel efficiency, engine size, etc.).
   - **Heatmap**:
     - Visualize the correlations between numerical features.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the plots and document your observations in the notebook.

5. **Export**:
   - Save the plots as PNG files in a folder.
   - Save and submit the notebook.
